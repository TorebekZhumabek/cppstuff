C++ STL Demonstration
=======
This is the first repository I created in C++. I have been writing programs in C language for years. Some of them are even written with `cpp` extension. But I have never used some C++ features. So in this repo, I would like to show you some examples of C++ STL.

`vectordemo`: A demonstration of `std::vector`. It's something similar to an array. But it contains more methods. It simply prints out everything inside the array.

`regexdemo`: A demonstration of `POSIX Basic Regular Expression` written in C language using `libgnurx` because I can't use the standard `C++11`'s regex library in `MinGW`.
